# useCallback hook
    + Performance optimization
    + What is useCallback hook ? Why we have to use it ?
    + How we have to use it ?

 + Here ParentComponent holds several other componenst
    & need for re-render of any one Component re-renders all other components
    ==> Performance Issues

 + To improve Performance, we have to restrict re-renders for ONLY the component 
    which needs to be re-rendered
    eg: If age is incremented, ONLY the Age, Button for Age should re-render
 
 + HOW do we optimize this?
    ->> React.memo
        is a Higher Order Component, that will prevent a functional component from being
        re-rendered, IF its props or state do not change.
 
       + So, while exporting, wrap the component with React.memo

       + Now, IF we click to Increase Age, we can observe some optimization, 
            but still the Button to increment Salary is also re-rendering
        
            REASON: because a new incrementSalary function is being created each time when 
                the ParentComponent re-renders
                * When dealing with functions, we always have to deal with reference equality
                i.e Even though two functions have the exact same behaviour, it does not mean they are 
                    equal to each other
                    Thus, the function incrementSalary before the re-render is different from the function after the re-render
                    & Since the function is a prop, React.memo sees that the prop is changed & will not prevent the re-render.

            HOW TO FIX THIS? 
                How to tell react that no need to create a new incrementSalary function when age is updated ?
                + --> useCallback Hook

    + WHAT is useCallback ?
        a hook that will return a memoized version of the callback function that only 
        changes if one of the dependencies has changed.
    
    + WHY we need ?
        It is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality
        to prevent unnecessary renders.

    + HOW to use it ?
        1) import useCallback hook(a function)  from react
        2) call it , it accepts two parameters, first is callback function & second is an array of dependencies
