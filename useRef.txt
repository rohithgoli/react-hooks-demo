# useRef
    + this hook makes it possible to access DOM nodes directly
        within functional component
    + eg: focussing a text input
        considering a login form
            As soon as the page loads, we want the username input field
            to be focussed

        As we want on page load, --> componentDidMount --> useEffect with empty Dependency array
        & to implement useRef

        1) import useRef from react
        2) create a ref variable by calling useRef & passing the initial value
        3) Once we create a ref, we need to attach it to the input element
            for this, we make use of reserved attribute "ref"
        4)
