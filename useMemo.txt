# useMemo hook
    + for performance optimization
    + we need a way to tell react, not to recalculate certain values unnecessarily
        especially when taking long time
        --> useMemo hook

    + Through useMemo hook, that will only  re-compute the cached value, when one of the dependencies
        changed

 + For the first argument to useMemo hook, we pass in the function whose return value needs to be cached
    In second argument, specify the array of dependencies
        Thus we are telling the react, in case of change in dependency, do not use cached value & 
        re-calculate the value 

 + useCallback vs useMemo
    + useCallback caches the provided function instance
    + useMemo invokes the provided function & caches its result

    + Thus If we need to cache a function --> useCallback
    + If we need to cache result --> useMemo
