#   What & Why of useReducer

    + useReducer --> used for state management
    + an alternative to useState
    + useState is built using useReducer
    + When to useReducer vs useState ?


# Concept of Reducer in JavaScript

    + useState - state
      useEffect - side effects
      useContext - context API
      useReducer - reducers

      If you have knowledge of redux, better will be understanding of reducers

      reduce method in js vs useReducer

    + reduce in JavaScript                          useReducer in React
        array.reduce(reducer, initialValue)             useReducer(reducer, initialState)
        singleValue = reducer(accumulator, itemValue)   newState = reducer(currentState, action)
                                                            *** action parameter is what dictates 
                                                            the tranasition of currentState to newState

    +   reduce method returns a single value            useReducer returns a pair of values,
                                                        [newState, dispatch]


# useReducer (Simple state & action)
    + Counter example using useReducer
    + 1) import useReducer from react
      2) Define reducer function & initialState outside the components
         action is an instruction to the reducer function by which it performs necessary tranasition
         + use switch stmt for actions 
      3) We need to get hold of value to display in jsx & we need to get a way to call reducer function
         with appropriate action
            useReducer returns an array containing state, dispatch
                dispatch method allows us to execute a particular action
                The argument to dispatch method is an action that is specificed in reducer method
