    + reduce in JavaScript                          useReducer in React
        array.reduce(reducer, initialValue)             useReducer(reducer, initialState)
        singleValue = reducer(accumulator, itemValue)   newState = reducer(currentState, action)
                                                            *** action parameter is what dictates 
                                                            the tranasition of currentState to newState

    +   reduce method returns a single value            useReducer returns a pair of values,
                                                        [newState, dispatch]
