# React Context API - What & why ?

    + In general, we have AppComponent as root component, and
        at nested at several other levels, we have other components

    + It would be nice if we can send data to component, without drilling to every level in 
        the component tree
    + Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down
        manually at every level


# How Context API was used, prior to hooks ?
    + We want to send data from App component to ComponentF
    + There are three steps to implement to make use of Context
        1) Create context - in App component
        2) Provide context with value & Provider must wrap children components 
            for value to be available
        3) Consume the context value

    + In case of Multiple contexts, While consuming multiple contexts, code will not be more readable
        & useContext hook allows us to do in more simpler way
