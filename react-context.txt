# react Context
    Avoids props drilling while passing data through the component tree

    + createContext, export Provider and Consumer components
    + Providing Context through Provider Component with value
    + Consuming Context using Consumer Component & passing the function as its child
        the function receives context value as its parameter, which can then be used to return
        the desired jsx

+ We can set default value while creating context. We can pass default value as a parameter to the 
    createContext
    This default value will ONLY be used if the component does not have a matching Provider in the
    component tree
