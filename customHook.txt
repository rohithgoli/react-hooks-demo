# custom hooks

    + It is encouraged to build custom hooks by extracting 
        component logic into reusable functions
    + Custom hook is a javascript function whose name starts with "use"
    + A custom hook can also call other hooks if required
    + Why ?
        share logic between components -> All HOCs & render props

# useInput
    + implemnet a simple form where the user can submit firstName & lastName
    + to encapsulate controlled component behaviour for input element i.e binding
        value & onChange
