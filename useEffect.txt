useEffect Hook

# Need for useEffect hook
    + while working with class components, we might have performed some side-effects for our components
        such as Updating DOM, 
                Fetching data from API endpoint
                Setting up subscriptions & timers
    + There are certain problems associated such as repetition of code in various component life cycle methods
        & unable to maintain functionality related to a side effect at single place.
    
    + The Effect hook lets us perform side effects in functional components
    + It is a close replacement for 
        componentDidMount,
        componentDidUpdate & 
        componentWillUnmount
